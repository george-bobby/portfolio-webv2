# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves enhancing the existing projects section by integrating advanced scroll-driven animations and parallax effects from the projects-new component. The goal is to create a more engaging and visually appealing projects showcase that maintains the current color theme and data structure while adding sophisticated scroll animations, responsive design, and a "View All Projects" section that appears after scrolling through the top 3 projects.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to experience smooth scroll-driven animations when viewing projects, so that I have an engaging and modern browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user scrolls through the projects section THEN the system SHALL display smooth parallax animations using CSS scroll-driven animations or Framer Motion
2. WHEN projects are in view THEN the system SHALL animate project cards with rotation, scaling, and opacity effects similar to projects-new
3. WHEN the user scrolls horizontally (desktop) THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance with hardware acceleration
4. IF the browser supports CSS scroll-driven animations THEN the system SHALL use native CSS animations for optimal performance
5. IF the browser does not support CSS scroll-driven animations THEN the system SHALL fallback to JavaScript-based animations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to see the top 3 projects with enhanced visual effects, so that I can quickly identify the most important work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the projects section loads THEN the system SHALL display exactly 3 featured projects from the existing projects data
2. WHEN each project is displayed THEN the system SHALL show project image, title, description, and technology tags with the current color theme
3. WHEN a project card is hovered THEN the system SHALL apply subtle hover animations and color transitions
4. WHEN projects are scrolled THEN the system SHALL apply staggered animation effects with different rotation angles and timing
5. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display projects in a vertical stack instead of horizontal scroll

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to access a "View All Projects" section after viewing the featured projects, so that I can explore the complete portfolio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user scrolls past 95% of the featured projects section THEN the system SHALL display a "View All Projects" button
2. WHEN the "View All Projects" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL navigate to the complete projects page
3. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL always show the "View All Projects" button below the featured projects
4. WHEN the button appears THEN the system SHALL animate it with a smooth fade-in transition
5. WHEN the button is hovered THEN the system SHALL apply hover effects consistent with the design system

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor using any device, I want the projects section to be fully responsive, so that I have an optimal viewing experience regardless of screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewed on desktop (â‰¥1024px) THEN the system SHALL display horizontal scrolling with pinned section behavior
2. WHEN viewed on tablet (768px-1023px) THEN the system SHALL adapt layout with appropriate spacing and sizing
3. WHEN viewed on mobile (<768px) THEN the system SHALL display vertical stacking with touch-friendly interactions
4. WHEN the viewport changes THEN the system SHALL smoothly adapt animations and layout without breaking
5. WHEN on touch devices THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch feedback and gesture support

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want the projects section to maintain visual consistency with the existing design, so that the experience feels cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the enhanced projects section is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the existing color theme and design tokens
2. WHEN project cards are rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain the current styling for backgrounds, text, and buttons
3. WHEN animations are applied THEN the system SHALL preserve the existing brand colors and gradients
4. WHEN typography is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the current font families and sizing hierarchy
5. WHEN interactive elements are shown THEN the system SHALL follow the existing button and link styling patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want smooth performance during scroll animations, so that the experience feels fluid and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scroll animations are active THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance on modern devices
2. WHEN multiple animations run simultaneously THEN the system SHALL use GPU acceleration and transform properties
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL initialize animations without blocking the main thread
4. WHEN animations complete THEN the system SHALL properly clean up event listeners and animation instances
5. WHEN performance is degraded THEN the system SHALL gracefully reduce animation complexity or disable non-essential effects
